House Price Prediction Model
Overview
This Python code implements a house price prediction model using a dataset with more than 80 features for training. The goal of this project is to create a reliable and accurate model that can predict house prices based on various input features.

Features
Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset that includes more than 80 features related to houses. These features may include information such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, amenities, and more.

Machine Learning Model: The core of this project is a machine learning model that learns from the provided dataset to make predictions about house prices. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques to find patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable (house prices).
